## Overview

<p> Welcome, to my ReadME for my Emerging Technologies' Assessment due by Decemeber 13th. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that I have achieved the learning outcomes of this module while also providing myself with sample work to show prospective employers. 
</p>

<p>The following component will be graded for this assessment, my GitHub repository, Scikit-Learn jupyter notebook, and Quantum Computing Jupyter Notebook. Included in my repository are the 2 notebook I mentioned above. The Scikit-Learn notebook will contain a detailed overview of the scikit-learn python library, 3 scikit algorithm I found interesting, and plots/visualisation of the algorithm. The Quantum Computing Jupyter notebook will contain a clear and concise comparison of quantum computing and classical computing, and an explanation of Deutschâ€™s algorithm and code simulating it using qiskit.
